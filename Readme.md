This repository tracks my progress for Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) practice.

Repository layout
-----------------

- `concepts/` — Each concept has its own subfolder (for example `arrays/`, `linked-list/`, `graphs/`) containing short notes, explanations, and a few curated practice questions.
- `problems/` — Topic-wise subfolders containing problem solutions (from LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, and problems covered in Striver's A2Z DSA Course). Each problem folder/file includes the problem link, approach notes, and the code solution.

How I use this repo
--------------------

- Add concise notes and key ideas under `concepts/<concept>/` as you learn them.
- For every problem you solve, add a file under `problems/<topic>/` with the problem name, link, short approach, and solution file(s).
- Name code files clearly (e.g., `two-sum.js`, `reverse-linked-list.py`) and include the problem URL in a comment at the top.
- Keep solutions small and focused; prefer readable code and a short explanation instead of only pasting the final code.

Contributing to myself
----------------------

This is a personal tracker, but if you reuse it or share it with others, follow these conventions:

- Add a short note explaining the difficulty and time spent solving the problem.
- If you add a new topic folder, update the "Topics covered" list below.

Topics covered (numbered)
--------------------------

1. 

Notes
-----

- This list is a living document. Add new topics as you progress through Striver's A2Z course or other resources.
- Prefer linking to the exact resource (LeetCode/GFG problem URL) inside problem files.

How to update this README
-------------------------

- Open `Readme.md` and edit the "Topics covered" numbered list to add/remove topics you have completed.
- Optionally, maintain a small CHANGELOG.md or a weekly progress note in `concepts/` to track what you learned each week.

Happy practicing — keep the problems small and explanations clear. Good luck!
